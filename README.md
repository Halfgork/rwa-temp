**Starly** is a decentralized reward platform built on the **Stellar Blockchain**, powered by **Soroban smart contracts**. Users earn XLM tokens by completing off-chain tasks created by project owners. Users who **stake XLM tokens** gain access to **exclusive reward tasks**. All staked tokens are securely held in the contract, and task validation is handled manually by project admins.

## 📌 Project Description

Starly is a Web3 reward app where users earn **XLM** tokens by completing tasks. Projects create tasks and users manually complete them off-chain. Tasks are rewarded once approved. Users who stake their tokens directly inside the smart contract gain access to higher-value or exclusive missions. With fast, low-fee Stellar transactions and Soroban's smart contract power, Starly brings engagement and real utility to blockchain communities.

## 🌍 Vision Statement

Starly’s goal is to make Web3 user engagement real, simple, and scalable. By combining token staking with a task-based reward system, it helps communities grow while rewarding true contributors. Powered by Stellar’s speed and Soroban’s programmability, it provides a low-cost, secure, and transparent way to engage users. Starly opens the door for any project to attract real participation, not just clicks — helping create a more sustainable and inclusive blockchain world.
